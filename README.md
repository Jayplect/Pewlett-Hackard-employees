## Desciption
I performed a research about people at Pewlett Hackard employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. For this project, I designed tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then queried the database for some specific information the data. The project work flow is as follows developed through this project inlcudes **data Engineering**, **data Modelling**, **data Analysis**, **Entity Relationship Diagraming**.
