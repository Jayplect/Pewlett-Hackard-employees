## Desciption
I performed a research about people at Pewlett Hackard employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. For this project, I designed tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then queried the database for some specific information the data. The project work flow is as follows developed through this project inlcudes:

## Project Steps
### Data Modelling
A <a href = https://github.com/Jayplect/sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/conceptual_schema.txt> conceptual schema </a> was created in order to identify relationships amongst the data. The conceptual schema was tansformed into an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). I used <a href =https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/> QuickDBD </a> app to make the ERD.  In the ERD I identified and showed all primary keys and mapped foreign keys. The foreign mapping included one to many and many to many relationship.
